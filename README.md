# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language
Scala is a mature programming language with a history spanning over ten years and almost 30k commits. Recently, it has become a prominent language for data scientists. Scala is also an open source project, which means that its entire development history, including changes made, code reviews, etc., is publicly available.

In this project, we aim to analyze the real-world project repository of Scala, which contains data from a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site (GitHub). We will clean up the data, visualize it, and identify the individuals who have had the most influence on the language's development, as well as those who are the experts in the field.
